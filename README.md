# UniLink-system---Java-FX-UI-Implementation-and-Data-Persistence


In this project, we have designed and implemented Java Application called UniLink. This application allows all students in a university to create
and publish various types of posts and reply to those posts. Users of the UniLink system can also view all the posts, manage their own posts, review all replies to their posts,
close and delete their own posts. 
We have implemented the User Interace using Java FX and Scene Builder and Data Persistance using embedded HSQLDB.
